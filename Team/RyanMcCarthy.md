Hi everyone, thanks for visiting my file. A little bit about myself. I am a full stack developer both professionally and recreationally. I really like movies so I'm glad to be making an application revolving around them. I wouldn't say I have one specialization as I like to be a jack of all trades from the styling of the UI down to the database. As Tom Brady would say, "Let's go!".

Favorite Tobey Maguire Film: Seabiscuit

Thanks for reading.
