My name is Sashank Yalavarthy. I started out with Java and C++, the former of which I've been fluent in since. Over the years, I've learned a few more things: Objective C, Python, Javascript, HTML, and some iOS app development. I've done a game development internship and another one for web dev. I'm most familiar with front end web design, (jQuery, Bootstrap) making dynamic pages with javascript and have also dabbled in some backend stuff. Also moderate experience with MySQL. My favorite Tobey Maguire quote is: "Thanks, hot legs."
