# Tobey's-Tots
Movie Review Website
The bulk of review websites use a solitary rating metric as an overall estimation of the movies quality but, like all forms of artistic expression movies appeal to a wide variety of audiences and many peoples tastes are different. To fill what we percieve as a problem in the traditional method of movie review we are proposing a site that will allow users to judge movies on many of their different qualities. With this new approach to topic review we plan on creating a web application that will allow the user to curate movies based on more specific queries than "Best action movie".

We plan on having data storage and server-side features.
